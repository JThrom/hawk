# Hawk — Specification

Hawk is a terminal user interface (TUI) application launcher and management
layer. It discovers, organizes, and launches other installed TUIs, and connects
to a community registry to suggest new ones. The long-term vision is an
all-terminal operating environment where tmux (or zellij) acts as the tiling
window manager and Hawk provides the main menu / application launcher.

---

## 1. Vision

- Terminal-native "operating system" experience.
- The terminal multiplexer (tmux, zellij) provides tiling window management.
- **Hawk is the "start menu" / launcher button of this terminal OS.** If tmux is
  the tiling window manager, Hawk is the Start button (Windows) / menu button
  (Linux Mint / Ubuntu): the single entry point from which every other TUI is
  discovered and launched.
- Users find TUIs **by function**, launch them into new tmux windows, and
  (later phases) discover and install new TUIs from a shared registry.

---

## 1a. Primary Use Case — Agentic AI workflow hub over SSH + tmux

This is the north-star scenario. Every feature must support it.

**Who / why:** A software engineer running agentic AI workflows (e.g. OpenCode +
a cloud LLM) on a primary always-on machine. Humans are the bottleneck, so the
engineer stays connected from portable, power-efficient **thin-client devices**.
The primary machine keeps working and preserves state even when the thin client
loses connectivity, runs out of battery, or the user steps away.

**How it works:**
- Everything runs over **terminal + SSH + tmux** on a **small screen** for power
  efficiency. No GUI.
- Server-side tmux session persists all work; the thin client just attaches.
- Workflow: start a tmux session → launch **Hawk in the first window** → use
  Hawk to launch every other TUI **into new tmux windows** depending on the
  task at hand.
- Hawk is the always-available menu that ties the session together.

**Implications for design (hard requirements):**
- **Small-screen first.** Layout, lists, and detail must remain usable on narrow
  terminals. Never assume a large viewport.
- **tmux-new-window launching is the primary path**, not an afterthought.
- **Fast, low-overhead, keyboard-only.** Works well over latent SSH links.
- **Robust when detached/reattached.** No assumptions about a persistent client.
- **Find-by-function is essential** (see §8): the user frequently cannot recall
  an app's name and must locate it by what it *does*.

## 2. Technology Stack

| Concern        | Decision                                              |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Runtime        | Bun                                                   |
| Language       | TypeScript                                            |
| TUI framework  | OpenTUI (`@opentui/core`, ≥ 0.4.5)                    |
| Distribution   | npm / bun global package (`bunx hawk` / `npx hawk`)   |
| Config format  | YAML (`~/.config/hawk/config.yaml`)                   |
| Registry files | YAML source, compiled to `index.json` artifact        |
| Registry fetch | jsDelivr CDN (fallback: raw.githubusercontent.com)    |

Rationale:
- **Bun**: OpenTUI's first-class runtime. Fast startup, native FFI for the Zig
  core, easy global install.
- **TypeScript**: type safety for registry schemas, OS/multiplexer detection,
  and package-manager adapters.
- **OpenTUI**: same maintainers as OpenCode; native Zig core with TS bindings,
  component/renderable model, high performance.

---

## 3. Environment Awareness

Hawk detects and adapts to its runtime environment.

### 3.1 Operating system / distro
- Detect OS: Linux, macOS.
- Detect Linux distro family to pick the right system package manager
  (Debian/Ubuntu → apt, Arch → pacman, Fedora/RHEL → dnf).

### 3.2 Terminal
- Detect terminal capabilities (color depth, size) via OpenTUI + env
  (`$TERM`, `$COLORTERM`).

### 3.3 Terminal multiplexer
- Detect if running inside **tmux** (`$TMUX`) or **zellij** (`$ZELLIJ`).
- Deep integration with tmux and zellij for launching apps in new windows.

### 3.4 Package managers & compilers
- Detect installed package managers and query them for installed packages:
  `brew`, `apt`/`dpkg`, `pacman`, `cargo`, `npm`/`bun` global, `pipx`/`pip`,
  `dnf`/`rpm`.
- Awareness of installed compilers/runtimes informs which install commands are
  viable (e.g. `cargo install` needs the Rust toolchain).

---

## 4. App Discovery

Hawk determines which TUIs are installed by **matching a known catalog against
the system** (never noisy heuristic guessing).

Two complementary match strategies, run together so newly-installed apps are
always caught. **A key goal is detecting apps that are NOT in `/bin`** — many
TUIs are installed globally via npm/cargo/pip/pipx and live in per-tool bin dirs
(`~/.cargo/bin`, the npm/bun global prefix, pipx venvs) or have no conventional
binary name at all:

1. **PATH match** — for each catalog entry's known binary name(s), check the
   entire `$PATH` (not just `/bin`), so cargo/npm/pipx bin directories on the
   user's PATH are covered.
2. **Package-manager match** — query each detected package manager's installed
   package list and cross-reference catalog entries by **package name**. This
   catches apps whose binary name differs from the command the user remembers,
   or that a simple PATH scan would miss.

Because users search by function (§8) and often can't recall names, discovery
must be as complete as possible: the union of these strategies is what makes an
installed app findable by its description/tags rather than only by an exact
binary name the user would have to already know.

The "catalog" is:
- **MVP**: a static seed catalog bundled inside the Hawk binary/package.
- **Phase 2+**: the remote registry `index.json` (bundled seed remains the
  offline fallback). The same match logic is reused — swapping the data source
  requires no rework.

### 4.1 Scan caching
- Scan results are cached to disk (`~/.cache/hawk/`).
- On launch, cached results are shown instantly.
- A background re-scan refreshes results; a manual refresh key forces re-scan.
- This surfaces newly-installed apps without slow startup (pkg-manager queries
  are expensive).

---

## 5. Registry (Phase 2+)

### 5.1 Ownership
- A dedicated repo owned by the project (e.g. `hawk-registry`).
- Community contributes apps via pull request.

### 5.2 Structure
- **Source**: a directory of per-app YAML files (one file per app).
  YAML chosen for human-friendliness in PRs and inline comments.
- **Artifact**: CI in the registry repo compiles all app files into a single
  `index.json` manifest (and a fixed category taxonomy). Hawk fetches the one
  index — no directory listing needed on the CDN.

### 5.3 Fetch & caching
- Fetch `index.json` via jsDelivr CDN; fall back to raw.githubusercontent.com.
- Cache to disk with a **configurable TTL** (default 24h) in
  `~/.cache/hawk/`.
- Use cache offline; refresh in the background when stale.
- Registry URL(s) and TTL are configurable in `config.yaml`.

### 5.4 Per-app entry schema
Each app entry contains:
- `id` — stable unique identifier
- `name` — display name
- `description` — search + display text
- `categories` / `tags` — canonical categories (see §7) + free tags
- `binaries` — one or more binary names for PATH/pkg detection
- `install` — install commands keyed by package manager
  (e.g. `{ brew: "...", cargo: "...", apt: "..." }`)
- `homepage` / `repo` — outbound links
- `popularity` — stars / rank signal for search ordering
- `language` — implementation language/runtime (Rust, Go, Python, …)

(Screenshots/asciinema intentionally excluded — impractical in a TUI.)

---

## 6. Launching Apps

### 6.1 Inside a multiplexer (tmux / zellij)
- Default: launch the selected app in a **new window**.
- (Future/config: option to launch in a new pane / split.)
- tmux: `tmux new-window <cmd>`; zellij: equivalent action.

### 6.2 Without a multiplexer
- **exec / replace** the Hawk process: Hawk hands the terminal to the app.
  On app exit, control returns to Hawk (re-launch or shell wrapper).
- Simple, works everywhere, no lingering Hawk process needed.

---

## 7. Categories

### 7.1 Taxonomy source
- **Registry-defined, fixed taxonomy** — the registry owns the canonical
  category list for consistency. (MVP: same taxonomy baked into the seed.)

### 7.2 Auto-generated special categories (pinned at top)
- **Favorites** — user-pinned apps (persisted locally).
- **Recent** — recently launched apps (from local usage tracking).

---

## 8. Search — Find by Function (core principle)

**Hawk's primary job is to help users find TUIs by what they DO, not by name.**
TUI apps frequently have whimsical or non-descriptive names (`claws` is an AWS
client, `yazi`/`nnn` are file managers, `btop` is a system monitor). Users
routinely cannot recall these names — especially for the many tools they have
installed — so name-only matching is insufficient by design.

### 8.1 Requirements
- Search must weight **description and tags heavily**, alongside name/id/binary.
  - `calculator` must surface calculator apps, not just apps with "calculator"
    in the name.
  - `AWS` must find `claws` (and other AWS tools) via its description/tags even
    though the name contains no "AWS".
- Function/utility matches are first-class results, ranked competitively with
  name matches — not a fallback shown only when names miss.
- This applies to **installed apps first** (the user forgetting the name of
  something they already have is the most common case) and to registry
  suggestions.
- Rich, accurate **tags** in the registry are therefore load-bearing. Registry
  entries should carry function/synonym tags (e.g. `aws`, `cloud` on `claws`;
  `calculator`, `math` on calculator apps). Curating tags is part of the
  project's scope, not optional metadata.

### 8.2 Behavior
- **Always-on, type-to-filter, fuzzy.** Typing filters live; no modal search
  mode required.
- Results are **two grouped sections**:
  1. **Installed** matches (always above), scored across name + id + binaries +
     **tags + description**.
  2. **Registry** suggestions (below), scored the same way + popularity.
- Examples:
  - `calculator` → installed calculators first, then registry calculators.
  - `aws` → installed `claws` (matched via tags/description), then registry AWS
    TUIs.
  - `file manager` → `yazi`, `nnn`, `ranger`, … regardless of name.

---

## 9. Install Flow (Phase 3)  (IMPLEMENTED)

- User selects a registry (not-installed) app and presses `i` (or `Enter`).
- Hawk **auto-picks** the best package manager: the intersection of the app's
  declared install commands and the managers detected on the system, ordered by
  `managerPreference`. The `m` key cycles through the other viable managers
  before installing. [done]
- Inside a multiplexer, the install runs in a **new window** (`sh -c` wrapping
  the command), streaming output; the window stays open at the end (`read`) so
  results/prompts are visible. Hawk keeps running. [done]
- Without a multiplexer, Hawk **suspends** the renderer, runs the install inline
  with inherited stdio (so sudo/interactive prompts work), then **resumes**. [done]
- Privilege escalation is handled entirely by the underlying command — Hawk
  never touches credentials. [done]
- On completion, Hawk **re-scans** and the app moves into the installed set. In
  window mode the install is async, so the detail line prompts pressing `r` when
  it finishes. [done]
- When no available manager can install an app, Hawk shows the manual command,
  and — if the registry provides `installNotes` (extracted from the project's
  README) — the user can press `v` to open a scrollable **install-notes
  overlay** with the project's own instructions. This covers the many TUIs
  distributed only via `go install`, source builds, or one-off scripts.
- The registry enriches entries from GitHub READMEs (install commands, package
  names, language, tags, and the install section) so install coverage is broad
  without hand-curation. Supported managers include `go` (in addition to
  brew/apt/pacman/cargo/npm/bun/pipx/pip/dnf).
- Package-manager preference order is configurable in `config.yaml`
  (`managerPreference`). Install/cycle keys are rebindable (`install`,
  `cycleManager`).

## 10. UI / Interaction

### 10.1 Layout
- **Three-column, Miller-column style** (widths 20% / 20% / 60%):
  1. **Categories** (left, 20%).
  2. **Apps** in the selected category / search results (middle, 20%).
  3. **Details** (right, 60%) — a rich multi-line panel for the
     selected app: name + installed/available badge, wrapped description, and
     enrichment facts (language, category, tags, stars, command, homepage), plus
     contextual install/launch guidance and the transient status line.
- A top **search bar** spans the full width.
- **Overlays** (absolute, centered, dismiss with Esc):
  - **Install notes** (`v`) — scrollable README install section.
  - **Keybindings help** (`Ctrl+H`) — full, aligned list of bindings.
- No persistent bottom help bar (reclaimed for content); help lives in the
  Ctrl+H modal. Small-screen-first: columns and wrapping keep it usable on
  narrow terminals.

### 10.2 Keybindings
- **Vim keys and arrows both** supported.
  - `h/j/k/l` + arrow keys — navigate / switch pane
  - `Enter` — launch (installed) or install (available) selected app
  - `i` — install · `m` — cycle package manager · `v` — install notes
  - `f` — toggle favorite
  - typing — live fuzzy search · `Esc` — clear search / close overlay
  - `r` — force re-scan + registry refresh
  - `Ctrl+H` — keybindings help modal
  - `q` / `Ctrl+C` — quit
- **Fully rebindable** via `config.yaml` (the help modal reflects the active
  bindings).

---

## 11. Configuration

- Location: `~/.config/hawk/config.yaml` (XDG).
- Philosophy: **maximize configurability** — devs value config + extensibility.
- Covers at minimum:
  - keybindings (full rebind map)
  - cache TTLs (registry, scan)
  - registry URL(s) / mirrors
  - launch defaults (window vs pane; multiplexer preference)
  - package-manager preference order
  - favorites list / pinned apps
  - enabled/disabled package-manager scanners
  - theme / colors (future)

---

## 12. Local State & Privacy

- Stored under `~/.cache/hawk/` (caches) and `~/.local/share/hawk/` or
  config dir (persistent state such as favorites & usage counts).
- **Usage tracking is local-only** and never leaves the machine. It records
  launch counts + timestamps to power **Recent** and (future) **Frequent**.

---

## 13. Phased Roadmap

### Phase 1 — MVP (local launcher)
- Environment detection (OS, terminal, multiplexer, package managers).
- App discovery via **bundled static seed catalog** (PATH + pkg-manager match).
- Scan caching with background/manual refresh.
- Two-pane browse UI with categories.
- Always-on fuzzy search over installed apps.
- Launch: new window in tmux/zellij; exec-replace fallback.
- Favorites (pinned) + Recent special categories.
- Local usage tracking.
- YAML config with rebindable keys, TTLs, launch defaults.
- No network / registry.

### Phase 2 — Registry discovery  (IMPLEMENTED)
- Local generated registry (`data/registry.yaml`, built from awesome-tuis by
  `scripts/gen-registry.ts`) merged with the seed. [done]
- Search shows registry suggestions in an "Available to install" section below
  installed results, with install-command hints in the detail line. [done]
- Registry-driven catalog augments the seed for detection (breadth). [done]
- Remote `dist/index.yaml` fetch via jsDelivr → raw.githubusercontent fallback,
  disk cache with configurable TTL, offline degradation (fresh cache → network →
  stale cache → local), background refresh. Enabled by default. [done]
- Precedence when merging: seed > remote > local. Seed keeps curated
  install/package metadata; registry contributes the long tail.
- Registry repo `JThrom/hawk-registry` is live: per-app `apps/<id>.yaml` sources
  + `categories.yaml`, compiled by CI (GitHub Actions) into
  `dist/index.yaml`, served via
  `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/JThrom/hawk-registry@master/dist/index.yaml`. [done]

Phase 2 complete. Note: the index is YAML (not JSON); the fetcher parses YAML,
which is a JSON superset, so the local disk cache remains JSON for fast reads.

### Phase 3 — Install flow  (IMPLEMENTED)
- Auto-pick package manager with in-app cycling override (`m`), install via `i`.
- New-window streaming install in a multiplexer; suspend/resume inline install
  otherwise. Re-scan on completion. Configurable pkg-manager preference order.
- See §9 for details.

### Phase 4 — Updates & extras
- "Updates Available" category (compare installed vs registry versions).
- Frequent category, richer theming, additional multiplexers, pane launching.

---

## 14. Open Questions / Deferred

- Version comparison strategy for "Updates Available" (Phase 4).
- Additional multiplexers beyond tmux/zellij (screen, wezterm) — deferred.
- Theming system specifics.
- Windows support — out of scope for now.
